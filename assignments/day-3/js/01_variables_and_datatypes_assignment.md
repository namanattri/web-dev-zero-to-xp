# Assignment 1: Variables and Data Types

Complete the following coding challenges to practice working with variables and data types in Python.

---

## Question 1: Variable Swap
Write a program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.

**Sample Output:**
```
Before swap: x = 5, y = 10
After swap: x = 10, y = 5
```

---

## Question 2: Personal Information
Create variables to store your name, age, height (in meters), and whether you're a student. Print them in a formatted sentence.

**Sample Output:**
```
My name is Alice, I am 20 years old, 1.65 meters tall, and I am a student: True
```

---

## Question 3: Temperature Converter Variables
Create variables for a temperature in Celsius (25°C). Convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, storing each in separate variables. Print all three.

**Formula:** 
- Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32
- Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15

**Sample Output:**
```
25°C = 77.0°F = 298.15K
```

---

## Question 4: String Properties
Create a variable with your favorite quote. Print the quote, its length, first character, and last character.

**Sample Output:**
```
Quote: "To be or not to be"
Length: 18
First character: T
Last character: e
```

---

## Question 5: Type Checking
Create variables of different types (int, float, string, boolean). Print each variable along with its type.

**Sample Output:**
```
42 is of type <class 'int'>
3.14 is of type <class 'float'>
Hello is of type <class 'str'>
True is of type <class 'bool'>
```

---

## Question 6: String to Number
Ask the user for two numbers as strings. Convert them to integers, add them, and print the result.

**Sample Input:**
```
15
27
```

**Sample Output:**
```
The sum is: 42
```

---

## Question 7: Boolean Logic
Create a variable `is_sunny` set to True and `is_warm` set to True. Create a third variable `is_perfect_day` that is True only if both conditions are True. Print the result.

**Sample Output:**
```
Is it a perfect day? True
```

---

## Question 8: Multiple Assignment
Use multiple assignment to create three variables (x, y, z) with values 10, 20, 30 in a single line. Print them.

**Sample Output:**
```
x = 10, y = 20, z = 30
```

---

## Question 9: String Concatenation
Create variables for first name, middle name, and last name. Combine them into a full name with proper spacing.

**Sample Output:**
```
Full Name: John Michael Doe
```

---

## Question 10: Circle Calculations
Create a variable for the radius of a circle (e.g., 5). Calculate and store the circumference and area in separate variables. Use π = 3.14159.

**Formulas:**
- Circumference = 2 × π × radius
- Area = π × radius²

**Sample Output:**
```
Radius: 5
Circumference: 31.4159
Area: 78.53975
```

---

## Question 11: Data Type Conversion Chain
Start with the string "42". Convert it to an integer, then to a float, then back to a string. Print the result after each conversion along with its type.

**Sample Output:**
```
Original: '42' <class 'str'>
To int: 42 <class 'int'>
To float: 42.0 <class 'float'>
Back to string: '42.0' <class 'str'>
```

---

## Question 12: Variable Reassignment
Create a variable `count` with value 0. Reassign it to 5, then to 10, then to 15. Print after each reassignment.

**Sample Output:**
```
Count: 0
Count: 5
Count: 10
Count: 15
```

---

## Question 13: String Methods
Create a variable with a mixed-case sentence. Print it in uppercase, lowercase, and title case.

**Sample Output:**
```
Original: Hello World Python
Uppercase: HELLO WORLD PYTHON
Lowercase: hello world python
Title Case: Hello World Python
```

---

## Question 14: Numeric Operations with Types
Create an integer variable (10) and a float variable (3.5). Add them and print the result with its type.

**Sample Output:**
```
10 + 3.5 = 13.5
Result type: <class 'float'>
```

---

## Question 15: Price Calculator
Create variables for item price (19.99) and quantity (3). Calculate the total cost and format it to 2 decimal places.

**Sample Output:**
```
Item price: $19.99
Quantity: 3
Total cost: $59.97
```
