# # Assignment 2: Operators

# ## Question 15: Quadratic Discriminant
# Calculate the discriminant of a quadratic equation (b² - 4ac) and determine the nature of roots.
# - Discriminant > 0: Two real roots
# - Discriminant = 0: One real root
# - Discriminant < 0: No real roots

# **Sample Input:**
# ```
# a = 1
# b = -3
# c = 2
# ```

# **Sample Output:**
# ```
# Discriminant: 1
# Nature of roots: Two real and distinct roots
